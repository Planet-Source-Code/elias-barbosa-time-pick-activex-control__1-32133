Please, click on the "vbgExample.vbg" to see the example of the
control with source code.

=================================

I added a Zip file called "OCX.zip". This file has the compiled 
ActiveX Control and a Visual Basic example. To run this Visual Basic
example, you have to register the ActiveX Control in your system. 

I added a file named "Easy DLL_OCX Register.reg". This file, if 
executed, will add 2 options to the context menu that appears when 
you right-click on a file with the ".ocx" or ".dll" extensions. The 
options added are "Register" and "UnRegister". You will be able, 
then, to register any OCX or DLL file just by right clicking on it 
and selecting "Register".
